# Development

## Toolchain

The repository is a Python 3.12 `uv` library project. Python provides the
development envelope for reference oracles and tooling; the inference engine is
implemented in Mojo.

Project dependencies track stable Mojo and MAX releases in `pyproject.toml`.
`uv.lock` records the exact reproducible environment. Do not add nightly package
indexes or prerelease flags to the default environment.

## Prerequisites

- `uv`
- a C linker
- Python 3.12, managed automatically by `uv` when necessary

Apple GPU development additionally requires a supported Apple Silicon Mac,
current macOS, Xcode 16 or later, and the Metal toolchain. Verify that full
Xcode is selected and that both public Metal compiler tools resolve before
beginning GPU work:

```bash
xcode-select -p
xcrun -f metal
xcrun -f metallib
```

The selected developer directory should point inside `Xcode.app`, not the
standalone Command Line Tools directory. On Xcode 26 or later, also verify that
the separately managed component reports `"status" : "installed"`:

```bash
xcodebuild -showComponent MetalToolchain -json
```

See the official [Mojo installation guide](https://mojolang.org/install/) and
[system requirements](https://mojolang.org/docs/requirements/).

## Reference machine

The initial Apple Silicon reference machine is a MacBook Pro with the following
stable hardware configuration:

- model identifier: `Mac16,7`;
- SoC: Apple M4 Pro;
- CPU: 14 cores (10 performance and 4 efficiency);
- GPU: 20 cores with Metal 4 support;
- unified memory: 24 GB;
- internal storage: 512 GB Apple SSD;
- published memory bandwidth: 273 GB/s.

The bandwidth figure is an Apple specification, not a measured project result.
See Apple's [MacBook Pro technical specifications](https://support.apple.com/121554).

The software environment observed on 2026-08-20 was:

- macOS 26.5.2 (`25F84`) with Darwin 25.5.0;
- Xcode 26.6 (`17F113`);
- Metal toolchain installed, build `17F109`;
- `uv` 0.12.5;
- Mojo 1.0.0 and MAX 26.5.0 as resolved by `uv.lock`.

This snapshot establishes the development environment; it does not prove that
a Mojo workload executed on the GPU. Every GPU result must report the runtime's
device and backend identity and must satisfy the project's
[evidence requirements](project.md#evidence).

Mutable conditions belong in each benchmark record rather than in this machine
profile. At minimum, record the current software versions, power source and
power mode, thermal state, attached displays, available memory, and repository
commit and dirty state. Do not record serial numbers, hardware UUIDs,
provisioning identifiers, usernames, or volume UUIDs.

## Setup

Create the locked environment and confirm the compiler version:

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run mojo --version
```

There is no need to activate `.venv`; `uv run` executes commands in the managed
environment.

## Tests

Mojo tests use `std.testing.TestSuite` and run as Mojo programs:

```bash
uv run mojo run -I src tests/test_import.mojo
```

The initial smoke test proves that the package resolves through the configured
source path. Future tests should assert numerical behavior rather than merely
exercise execution.

## Dependency updates

Upgrade stable packages intentionally:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package mojo --upgrade-package max
uv sync --locked
```

After an upgrade, verify the resolved versions and rerun all correctness and
benchmark checks before accepting the lockfile change.
